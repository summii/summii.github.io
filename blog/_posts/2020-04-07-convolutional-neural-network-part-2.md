The goal of a CNN is to produce a model whose parameters are image filters that describe the degree to which an images expresses various shapes. By learning the filters from an image set, the network is specialized to distinguish images in that set. 


I will skip this portion for now. If you want learn more about Backpropagation and derivatives, please visit [here](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/) and [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html)
