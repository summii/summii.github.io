Introduction to Fundamental Math Proof Techniques

### Statements

A mathematical statement is a statement that is either true or false, but not both.

1) 6 is an even integer
> It is a mathematical statement and true

2) 10 is an odd interger
> It is a mathematical statement and false

3) Delhi is the capital of India
> It is a mathematical statement and true

4) Bangalore is the best city in the world
> Not a mathematical statement and we do not know(but i feel so)

5) 2+2 = 5 
> It is a mathematical statement and false


### Logical Operations

In logic, there are operations for combining or modifying statements. Some of these operations are 'and', 'or', 'not' and 'if..then'.

<mark>NOT</mark> If 'p' is a statement, then 'not p' is defined to be:

	* true, when p is false

	* false, when p is true

The statement 'not p' is called the negation of p and denoted '¬p' or '~p'


<mark>AND</mark> If 'p' and 'q' are two statements then statement 'p and q' is defined to be:

	* true, when both p and q are both true

	* false, when p is false or q is false or both p and q are false

	denoted by p ^ q

<mark>OR</mark> If 'p' and 'q' are two statements, then the statement 'p or q' is defined to be:

	* true, when p is true or q is true or both p and q are true

	* false, when both p and q are false

	denoted by p ∨ q


<mark>If...Then</mark> If 'p' and 'q' are statements, then the statement 'if p then q' is defined to be:

	* true, when both p and q are both true or p is false

	* false, when both p and q are both true ir p is false

	denoted by p => q ( p implies q)

If p is false, we say p => q is vacuously true. For example, if samosa is made up of bitter gourd and than modi is prime minister.

The converse of p => q is true, q => p is not necessarily true.

If amit like all IPL cricket teams then he likes mumbai indians but if amit likes csk doesn't mean he likes all the IPL team.

<mark>If and Only If</mark> If 'p'  and 'q' are statements, the the statement 'p if and only if q' is defined to be:

	* true, when p and q are both true or both false

	* false, when one of p, q is true and the other is false.

	Denoted by p <=> q, when p <=> is true, we say that p and q equivalent.

<mark>Contra-positive</mark> The contra-positive of the statement 'p => q' is: '¬q => ¬p'


Note: These two statments are logically equivalent. That is, if one can prove 'p => q' means they also proved '¬q => ¬p' vice versa.


<mark>QUANTIFIERS</mark> Consider: X is even, Note this is not a statement and we could modify this to make statement.

1) when X=10, X is even

2) For every integer X, X is even

3) There exists an integer X such that X is even

The phrases 'for every' and 'there exists' are called quantifiers. We use ∀ to denote "for all" and ∃ for "there exists".
