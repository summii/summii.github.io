Welcome to sumeet's Blog!

This blog is intended to serve as a place to put things I have been working on.
Mostly things related to perceptual hashing along with various other projects.
Additionally, I hope these notes prove useful to somebody and perhaps lead to some
useful discussion and feedback.  


I hope these notes prove useful to someone.
