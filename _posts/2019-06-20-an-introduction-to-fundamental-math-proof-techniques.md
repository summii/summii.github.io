# Introduction to Fundamental Math Proof Techniques




### Statements

A mathematical statement is a statement that is either true of false, but not both.

1) 6 is an even integer
> It is a mathematical statement and true

2) 10 is an odd interger
> It is a mathematical statement and false

3) Delhi is the capital of India
> It is a mathematical statement and true

4) Bnagalore is the best city in the world
> Not a mathematical statement and we do not know(but i feel so)

5) 2+2 = 5 
> It is a mathematical statement and false


### Logical Operations

In logic, there are operations for combining or modifying statements. Some of these operations are 'and', 'or', 'not' and 'if..then'.

<mark>Not</mark> If 'p' is a statement, then 'not p' is defined to be:
	* true, when p is false
	* false, when p is true

The statement 'not p' is called the negation of p and denoted '$\neg$ p' or '~p'
