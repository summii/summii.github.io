The system of education is in crisis. We do not have to pay school teachers but we to computerized the education sector.
We are becoming more of business hub for first world countries. I am not advocating against use of technology in education sector
,however, that there has been too much use of technology in education sector. Childrens who are using technology from an early age
are tend to develop a short attention span, lack patience and ability to concentrate for long time.

####Bad Approach
Few days back i was trying my hands on painting(via technology), then i felt, the experience is reduce and now i can not feel 
the liquidness of color. Now, i am just using my finger to draw something...There is absence of smell, trying out to mix different
color to make new, attachment with painting.
According to Douglas Sloan:
#For the healthy development of growing children especially, the importance of an environment rich in sensory experience -- color, 
sound, smell, movement, texture, a direct acquantance with nature, and so forth -- cannot be too strongly emphasized.... At what 
points and in what ways will the computer in education only further impoverish and stunt the sensory experience so necessary to the 
health and full rationality of the human individual and society?... What is the effect of the flat, two-dimensional, visual, and 
externally supplied image, and of the lifeless though florid colors of the viewing screen, on the development of the young child's 
own inner capacity to bring to birth living, mobile, creative images of his[/her] own?
