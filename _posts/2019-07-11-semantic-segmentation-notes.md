### Semantic segmentation

- semantic segmentation of an image is to assign each pixel in the input image a semantic class in order to get pixel wise-dense classification

- semantic segmentation is understanding an image at pixel level, i.e we want to assign each pixel in the image an object class.



Network architecture
- A general semantic segmentation architecture can be broadly thought of as an encoder network followed by decoder network

- The encoder is usually is a pre-trained classification network like VGG/Resnet followed by decoder network

- The task of decoder is to semantically project the discriminative features(lower resolution) learnt by the encoder onto pixel space(higher resolution) to get a dense classification.

- Unlike classification where the end result of the very deep network is the only important thing, semantic segmentation not only require discrimination at pixel level but also a mechanism to project discriminative features learnt at different stages of the encoder onto the pixel space. Different architectures employ different mechanisms (skip connections, pyramid pooling etc) as a part of the decoding mechanism.

- unlike classification, we need dense pixel-wise predictions from our models


Network architecture - take two

- Problems of CNNs

  - pooling layers - pooling layers increase the field of view and are able to aggrgate the context while discarding the 'where' information. However, semantic segmentation requires the exact aligment of class maps and thus, needs the 'where' information to be preserved. 

- Two different classes of architectures in the literature to tackle this issue

  - First one is encoder-decoder architecture. Encoder gradually reduces the spatial dimension with pooling layers and decoder gradually recovers the object details and spatial dimensions

  - There are usually shortcut connections from encoder to decoder to help decoder recover the object details better.Ex: U-Net

- Conditional random fields (CRF) postprocessing are usually used to improve the segmentation. CRFs are graphical models which 'smooth' segmentation based on the underlying image intensities.They work based on the observation that similar intensity pixels tend to be labeled as the same class. CRFs can boost scores by 1-2%.



FCN(fully convolutional network) key features:
  - The features are merged from different stages in the encoder which vary in coarseness of semantic information.

  - The upsampling of learned low resolution semantic feature maps is done using deconolutions which are initialized with bilinear interpolation filters.

  - Excellent example for knowledge transfer from modern classifier network like VGG16, Alexnet to perform semantic segmentation

Terms:

  - Upsampling is the process of inserting zero-valued samples between original samples to increase the sampling rate.

  - FCN -32 : Directly produces the segmentation map from conv(last), by using a transposed convolution layer with stride 32

  - FCN -16 : Sums the 2x upsampled prediction from conv with pool and produces the segmentation map, by using a transposed convolution layer with stride 16 on top of that.

  - FCN-8: Sums the 2x upsampled conv with pool, upsample them with a stride 2 transposed convolution and sums them with pool3 and aaplied a transposed convolution layer

  - stride - An interger or tuple/list of 2 interger

  - Yield - Return sends a specified value back to its caller whereas yield can produce a sequence of values, The yield statement suspends function execution and sends a value back to caller, but retain enough state to enablefunction to resume.

  - cv2.fillpoly - The function fillpoly fills an area bounded by several polygonal contours

  - cv2.cvtcolor - convert color-space to another

  - pts - array of polygons where each polygon is represented as an array of points

  - npts - array of polygon vertex counters

  - expand.dims - expand the shape of an arrya

  - np.squeeze - remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of a array

  - np.zeros - return a new array of given shape and type, filled with zeros

  - Deconvolution layers allow the model to use every point with small image to "paint" a square in the larger one.

  - deconvolution layer aka transposed convolution

  - One apprach is to separate out upsampling to a higher resolution from convolution to compute the features

  - Deconvolutional networks strive to find  lost feaatures the may have previously not been deemed important to convolutional network task.

  - uppsampling refers to any technique that will, upsample your image to a higher resolution

  - unpooling - reverse max pooling

  - RMSprop - divide the learning rate for a weight by running average of magnitudes of recent gradients for that weight

  - RMSprop is a gradient based optimization technique

  - padding Itâ€™s an additional layer that we can add to the border of an image
