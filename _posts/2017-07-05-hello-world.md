Well. Finally got around to putting something of my own . 

My intentions are mainly to use this space as a way to document my weekend projects that I'm working on(or planning), so plan on it being pretty programming, data and statistics heavy - I get bored if I'm not learning something new or doing something I find challenging(and i am very new to this space, so don't except too much). I'm known to follow straight line about food and beer. 

There's a chance that i will post something non-techincal(if not sober) - hopefully the four people reading won't mind.
Cheers!!
