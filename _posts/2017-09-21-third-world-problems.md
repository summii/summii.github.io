The system of education is in crisis. We do not have money to pay school teachers but we want to computerized the education sector.
We are becoming more of business hub for first world countries. I am not advocating against use of technology in education sector, however, that there has been too much use of technology in education sector. Childrens who are using technology from an early age
are tend to develop a short attention span, lack patience and ability to concentrate for long time.

## Modern Approach

Few days back, i was trying my hands on painting(via technology), then i felt the experience is reduce and now i can not feel 
the liquidness of color. Now, i am just using my finger to draw something...There is absence of smell, absence of trying out to mix different
color to make new, attachment with painting.

According to Douglas Sloan:

>For the healthy development of growing children especially, the importance of an environment rich in sensory experience -- color, 
sound, smell, movement, texture, a direct acquantance with nature, and so forth -- cannot be too strongly emphasized.... At what 
points and in what ways will the computer in education only further impoverish and stunt the sensory experience so necessary to the 
health and full rationality of the human individual and society?... What is the effect of the flat, two-dimensional, visual, and 
externally supplied image, and of the lifeless though florid colors of the viewing screen, on the development of the young child's 
own inner capacity to bring to birth living, mobile, creative images of his[/her] own?

The point is that children benefit most from material that stimulates them to exercise their imagination and creativity. 

Computers are also effecting the student-teacher relationship. Students can not connect with computers emotionally and in future, there will be no films based on student-teacher complex relationship because technology already killed that emotional bridge.

## Goverment Role

No goverment is working towards 100% literacy achievement, in case, they are too focused to achieve 100% computer literacy.Not
saying that use of computers are bad but introducing computers to early age kids is what we need to ignore. You can not teach them by just asking them to punch buttons. 

Douglas Sloan says:

>It does not take a flaming Bolshevik, nor even a benighted neo-Luddite, to wonder whether all those computer companies, and their related textbook publishers, that are mounting media campaigns for computer literacy and supplying hundreds of thousands of computers to schools and colleges really have the interests of children and young people as their primary concern.

Goverment should focus on low-tech and experimental education system rather than introducing high-tech classrooms.
