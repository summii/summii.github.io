We're going to use python 2.7.If you don't have python 2.7, you need to download a proper version from <a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/">here</a> 

I assume that you know basics of python, otherwise you can brush-up your skill [here]("https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html").
