No one can deny the positive effects of mobile phones:
	
* Power to talk
* Taking pictures/Videos
* Games
* Music

and obvisouly they are some problems too . Lets discuss some negative effects and seriousness of these problems.

In my generation, parents said the same thing about Tv and they were right about it. In my case, It made me believe that i have a deep knowledge of all facts about any subject and Tv rises did correlate strongly with explosion of obesity and diabetes. I was bored of Tv after watchng one video multiple times and now a days there is always something new within easy reach on internet. It is harder to get bored these days. It is resultiing in increase in selfish behaviour.

In my opinion, we have very few numbers of youth who are mature enough to self-regulate and not get addicted to scrolling up and updateing their feed and who isn't obsessed with how other people's lives look. They chooses everything on the basis of what would look best on instagram.

>I've avoided most addictions, but the Internet got me because it became addictive while I was using it. Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction. We're all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it. That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world - Paul graham

Teenager's sense of groupthink is a much bigger problem than just instagram. I can feel that in current generation youth demands individuality and freedom to pursue thei dreams and passions.

Childrens are much happier if we force them to play outisde with their friends for an hour than watching videos on internet.
